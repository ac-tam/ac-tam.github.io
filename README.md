# GPA Calculator
https://ac-tam.github.io/GPA-Calculator/

Use this calculator to effortlessly calculate your grade point average in the 100 scale and 4.0 scale.
AP Classes and Gym are weighted automatically, and noncredit courses such as lab are not averaged in
<br>

<b>Note that the user must indicate PLTW classes since PupilPath does not designate PLTW classes as PLTW classes in their course names</b>
# How is my average calculated

1) Sum up your unweighted grades
2) Multiply your gym grade by 0.5 and add it to the other grades
3) Multiply all AP and PLTW grades by 1.1 and add them to the other grades
4) Divide this sum by your total credits. Usually, this is the number of classes - 0.5 (gym is 0.5 credits),<br> but you may have courses such as AP Physics 1 that are counted as 2.0 credits

# How to convert my average to 4.0 

1) Convert each grade to the 4.0 scale. https://pages.collegeboard.org/how-to-convert-gpa-4.0-scale
2) For each AP or PLTW class, add 1.0 to that number. For example, if you have a 3.7 in AP Calculus BC, it is a 4.7 weighted. 
3) Divide your gym grade by 2. A 4.0 is a 2.0, and so on.
4) Add all the grades up and divide by the credit count.

  <b>Contrary to popular belief, having an average above 93 does not automatically  mean you have a 4.0. 
  If you have the following grades: <br>
  92, 100, 100, 100 100, 100, 100, ... , 100 such that your GPA is 99.99, your GPA is a 3.99.</b>
